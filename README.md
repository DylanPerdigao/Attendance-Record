# Attendance-Record

[![Attendance Record](https://github.com/DylanPerdigao/Attendance-Record/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DylanPerdigao/Attendance-Record/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Setup
  - Fork this project
  - Create three secrets called "URL"(url of the login page), "USERNAME"(email) and "KEY"(password)
  - Make your schedule in .github/workflows/main.yml file

## Some informations
  - If the attendance is already marked, it will not remove it
  - If the attendance is not marked, it will mark it
  - If the class does not exist, it will do nothing
  - The workflow can have a latency of 5-10min

## Legal Advice
I am not responsible for the fraudulent use of this program, the intention is not to forget to mark your presence in classes. You need to disable the workflow if you're not present
